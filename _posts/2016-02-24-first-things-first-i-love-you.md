Back story, my girlfriend has multiple online dating profiles and she really likes OK Cupid. She tells me about the app and the cool people she meets via OK Cupid, mostly platonic friends (women/men).

The other day I sent her a text that I created an OK Cupid account. She replied "LOL" and nothing else.  
We have an open relationship. Open as in, no topic is off limits and full disclosure is encouraged. How should I take her LOL reply?
