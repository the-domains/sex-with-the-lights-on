**Bats Have Oral Sex- What's Stopping You?**

When I was younger I would kiss around the vagina. Spending lots of time around the thighs, belly, and kissing and biting the cheeks. It wasn't until my mid 20's that I tried it for the first time. My cousin on the other hand, was performing cunnilingus in his early teens. Now a days, I enjoy the act A LOT. I must say that my hesitation to performing cunnilingus has a little to do with something a woman that had a big influence on me as a youth telling me not to do it. Weird right!? I was about 15 years old when she told me. It wasn't much of a sex talk. She didn't give an reason why I shouldn't. Though she explicitly said not to.

Do you perform oral sex on your partner; cunnilingus or felation? Fruit bats do. I'm sure there are other animals that perform oral sex. I didn't put much thought into it until I saw this article on the Huffington Post called

["10 Things We Learned About Sex In 2013"][0]

. I found scientific articles that confirmed what I read on the Huffington Post. This

[ARTICLE][1]

says that bats do it for a variety of reasons outside of pleasure; prevents STD's for the female, increases the chances of fertilization, and a few others. So of course, I had to look on YouTube for it and yes, there's a video. It's above. I decided to post the Key & Peel video about oral sex because it's funny and discusses the topic also. Below you'll see that and the video of other primates engaging in oral sex.
