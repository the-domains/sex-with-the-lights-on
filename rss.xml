            <title><![CDATA[Teasing Isn’t Always Fun]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Teasing Isn’t Always Fun</h1><p>Ok, so the same girlfriend as the Online-Dating post that I’ve known for over 10 years believes fellatio is gross. We’ve been dating since February and she says that she’s more than happy to felate me (her word) when she’s comfortable and I’m all for that. I really don’t enjoy receiving fellatio if the other person isn’t into giving it. I can appreciate her concern for oral sex because until recently I had my reservations with cunnilingus. Now I enjoy it and I have performed oral sex on her, even tho’ she says she isn’t into it. She did say she enjoyed it and her body responded very well to my performance.</p></article>]]></description>
