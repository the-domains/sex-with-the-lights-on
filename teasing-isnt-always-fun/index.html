We’ve been dating since February and she says that she’s more than happy to felate me (her word) when she’s comfortable and I’m all for that. I really don’t enjoy receiving fellatio if the other person isn’t into giving it. I can appreciate her concern for oral sex because until recently I had my reservations with cunnilingus. Now I enjoy it and I have performed oral sex on her, even tho’ she says she isn’t into it. She did say she enjoyed it and her body responded very well to my performance.</p><p>Easing both our concerns:<br>When we first started dating she suggested that we get tested for STD’s (Chlamydia, gonorrhea, hiv, syphilis, papilloma, Herpes, hepatitis, and trichomoniasis). We were tested for the six of the eight at an AZ Health facility for $20 and passed with flying colors. Two of the last four (papilloma and trichomoniasis) men aren’t tested for and she hasn’t gotten around to testing for them. She doesn’t have health insurance.</p><p>Back to topic.</p><p>About 5 or 6 years ago when we were both dating other people we had a conversation about oral sex (fellatio and cunnilingus) and she said she enjoyed doing it for her partner. During our sexual encounters she would ask what I wanted and I would say oral sex in one of the many ways that I know how to politely say “suck my dick”. She would not respond and would ignore the request as if she didn’t hear me. I quickly noticed that she wasn’t as gung-ho about it and hinted that she would if I went first. I gave an impromptu performance one night before we went to bed and didn’t make any inclination that I wanted her to reciprocate that evening.</p><p>Later she told me that my repeated requests for oral sex were getting annoying and turning her off. She also said that she felt that I only serviced her because I wanted her to perform oral sex on me. That’s partly true. I wanted to do it for her and I wanted her to perform oral sex on me.</p><p>Throughout our dating relationship she likes to make oral sex (sucking dick) jokes whenever and where ever the opportunity presents itself. I admit that I participated in the beginning. I don’t any longer because I feel that she’s teasing me. I don’t understand how she can be ok with joking about fellatio and be offended when asked to perform fellatio.</p><p>I’ve gone the past 7 or 8 months without a blowjob and I’m starting to wonder what’s the point. The sex is good, but lacking. We’re great friends and will continue to be friends without the sex. In the beginning of our dating relationship I told her that I don’t want my last blowjob to be my last blowjob and don’t feel it should be. She said she understood. I also said that I’ll find a relationship with someone that enjoys giving and receiving oral sex even if that means ending this one. I have no intentions of lying to her.</p><p>I enjoy being teased during sex. It’s fun when the teasing ends with receiving what is desired. The constant licking and kissing around the penis and balls is wearing on me. The jokes are getting old.</p><p>Am I being teased or tortured.<br>What would you do?</p><p>Sincerely,<br>Girth Brooks<br>www.sexwiththelightson.net</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">Teasing Isn’t Always Fun</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
